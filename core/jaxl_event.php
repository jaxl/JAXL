/**
 * following kind of events are possible:
 * 1) hook i.e. if a callback for such an event is registered, calling function is responsible for the workflow from their on
 * 2) filter i.e. calling function will manipulate passed arguments and modified arguments will be passed to next chain of filter
 * 
 * As a rule of thumb, only 1 hook can be registered for an event, while more than 1 filter is allowed for an event
 * hook and filter both cannot be applied on an event
