- current bosh implementation in v3.x uses curl multi/async
  which causes problems when running in cgi environment
  either fix it or port v2.x bosh curl (blocking) 
  implementation to get it going
- write more and better tests
- port back major v2.x xep's into v3.x (muc, pubsub)
- enable cron jobs similar to v2.x here in v3.x
- replace select with libevent loop if available
  need a generic jaxlselect which can do all this
  while jaxlsocket and others can use it
- some more work on exception handling
