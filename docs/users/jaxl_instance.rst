JAXL Instance
=============

``JAXL`` instance configure/manage other :ref:`sub-packages <jaxl-instance>`.
It provides an event based callback methodology on various underlying object. Whenever required
``JAXL`` instance will itself perform the configured defaults.

Constructor options
-------------------

    #. ``jid``
    #. ``pass``
    #. ``resource``

        If not passed Jaxl will use a random resource value

    #. ``auth_type``

        DIGEST-MD5, PLAIN (default), CRAM-MD5, ANONYMOUS

    #. ``host``
    #. ``port``
    #. ``bosh_url``
    #. ``log_path``
    #. ``log_level``

        ``ERROR``, ``WARNING``, ``NOTICE``, ``INFO`` (default), ``DEBUG``

    #. ``force_tls``
    #. ``stream_context``
    #. ``pid_dir``

        Directory in which to write PID files. If set to `null` then PID files will no be written.
    #. ``sock_dir``

        Directory in which to write socket files. If set to `null` then socket files will no be written.

Available Event Callbacks
-------------------------

Following ``$ev`` are available on ``JAXL`` lifecycle for registering callbacks:

    #. ``on_connect``

        ``JAXL`` instance has connected successfully

    #. ``on_connect_error``

        ``JAXL`` instance failed to connect

    #. ``on_stream_start``

        ``JAXL`` instance has successfully initiated XMPP stream with the jabber server

    #. ``on_stream_features``

        ``JAXL`` instance has received supported stream features

    #. ``on_auth_success``

        authentication successful

    #. ``on_auth_failure``

        authentication failed

    #. ``on_presence_stanza``

        ``JAXL`` instance has received a presence stanza

    #. ``on_{$type}_message``

        ``JAXL`` instance has received a message stanza. ``$type`` can be ``chat``, ``groupchat``, ``headline``, ``normal``, ``error``

    #. ``on_stanza_id_{$id}``

        Useful when dealing with iq stanza. This event is fired when ``JAXL`` instance has received response to a particular

    #. ``on_{$name}_stanza``

        Useful when dealing with custom xmpp stanza

    #. ``on_disconnect``

        ``JAXL`` instance has disconnected from the jabber server
